# dork-recon

BigBountyRecon tool utilises 58 different techniques using various Google dorks and open source tools to expedite the process of initial reconnaissance on the target organisation. Reconnaissance is the most important step in any penetration testing or a bug hunting process. It provides an attacker with some preliminary knowledge on the target organisation. Furthermore, it will be useful to gain insights into what controls are in place as well as some rough estimations on the security maturity level of the target organisation.

This tool can be used in addition to your usual approach for bug hunting. The idea is to quickly check and gather information about your target organisation without investing time and remembering these syntaxes. In addition, it can help you define an approach towards finding some quick wins on the target.
